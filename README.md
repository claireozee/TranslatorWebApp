# **Name**
Ozee Translator

# **Description**
This project was created to explore the use of APIs. I combined my interest in actively learning French with wanting to develop my technical skills, so I created this web app with the aim of using it instead of the Google translate interface.

# **Template details**
I also took the opportunity to use Bootstrap. </br>
**Template Name:** iPortfolio </br>
**Template URL:** https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/ </br>
**Author:** BootstrapMade.com </br>
**License:** https://bootstrapmade.com/license/

(To do:

1. Basic HTML site using bootstrap
