# **#NAME:**
Translator Web App

# **DESCRIPTION:**
This project was created to explore the use of APIs. I combined my interest in actively learning French with wanting to develop my technical skills, so I created this web app with the aim of using it instead of the Google translate interface.

(To do:
Update it with questions people may have, extra info needed, steps I took, look at markdown format)


I also took the opportunity to use Bootstrap.
